    This class inherits from the
    TIPCommon.base.actions.base_action::Action class

    Args:
        name (str): The action name

    Attributes:
        enrichment_data (dict): This attribute holds the enrichment data for the
            current entity in each of the entity iterations.
            At the end of each iteration the entity's additional_properties
            attribute is updated with self.enrichment_data, meaning that this
            value should be set each time with new value - not appending to it
            the data each time.
        entity_results (Any): These are the entity results that should appear
            in the JSON results under this specific object

    Abstract Methods:
        - _get_entity_types(): Get the type of entities the action runs on
        - _perform_enrich_action(): Perform the main enrichment logic on an
            entity

    Private Methods:
        - _perform_action(): Do not override this method! This method combines
            The other abstract methods with more OOtB enrichment logic and
            passes it to the parent class to use in start()
