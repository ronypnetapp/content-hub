An Enrichment Action is a specialized task designed to gather supplemental context about alerts or
entities. To maintain data integrity and security, an action is only classified as "Enrichment" if
it meets the following criteria:

* Primary Purpose: The action must proactively fetch or retrieve data from an external or internal
  source.

* External State Preservation: The action must not create, update, or delete data in any external
  platform. It is strictly "Read-Only" regarding systems outside of Google SecOps.

* Internal State Constraints: The action must not modify existing Google SecOps data, with
  three specific exceptions. It is permitted only to:
    1. Add Case Comments.
    2. Create Case Insights.
    3. Update Entity fields/attributes (enriching the entity's profile).

Few other constraints:

* Actions named Ping must not be categorized as enrichment actions.

* Actions that download files must not be categorized as enrichment actions.

Here's a pseudocode example of how to determine whether an action is an enrichment
action:

```
def is_enrichment_action(action):
    # Rule 0.1: Ping actions are not enrichment actions
    if action.name == "Ping":
        return False

    # Rule 0.2 Actions that download files are not enrichment actions
    if is_download_action(action):
        return False

    # Rule 1: Must fetch data to be considered enrichment
    if not action.fetches_data:
        return False

    # Rule 2: Absolute ban on mutating external systems
    if action.can_mutate_external_data:
        return False

    # Rule 3: Check for internal mutations
    if action.can_mutate_internal_data:
        # Define the only allowed internal mutations
        allowed_mutations = [
            action.can_create_insight,
            action.can_update_entities,
            action.can_add_comments
        ]

        # If it modifies internal data NOT in the allowed list, it's not enrichment
        if action.modifies_other_internal_fields(except_for=allowed_mutations):
            return False

    # If it passes all checks, it is a valid enrichment action
    return True
```"""
            )
        ),

    ENRICHMENT = "Enrichment"
