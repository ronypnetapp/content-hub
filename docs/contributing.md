### How to get access to Google SecOps for development purposes

In order to get access to the Google SecOps platform, you need to submit
this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7LYpIPhzFAYLo2NPpl5NUBX6h2zG4rDlLjWjm2Ic_U2FhZg/viewform).
The form will be triaged by our Partner Management team. We might reach out to get more details. If
everything is resolved, you will receive a Development License and access to Google SecOps.

If you already have access to Google SecOps through mutual customers/partners, then you can skip
this step and start contributing.

### Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests)
for this purpose.

### Review Process

* **Validations**: Ensure all automated checks pass.
* **Ready for Review**: If you opened your PR as a "Draft", please mark it as "Ready for Review"
  once all validations pass. This signals to maintainers that the code is ready for inspection.
* **Version Bump**: If you are modifying an existing content, remember to increase the version of
  that content. This is required for the changes to be released.

### CI Skip Labels

You can add these labels to a PR to skip expensive CI jobs during development:

| Label | What it skips | When to use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `ci-minimal` | All builds, integration tests, and Windows pipeline | Draft PRs, quick iterations |
| `skip-windows` | Windows integration validate/test/build (keeps `test-mp-windows`) | When Linux CI is sufficient |
| `skip-tests` | Integration test suite | Iterating on `mp` or package internals |
| `skip-build` | All build jobs | When validate + lint is enough |

**Important:** Remove skip labels before requesting review. All CI checks should pass before merge.

### Pre-Submission Checklist

Before submitting your Pull Request, please review
the [Pull Request Template Checklist](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
Ensuring your contribution meets these criteria will help speed up the review process.
