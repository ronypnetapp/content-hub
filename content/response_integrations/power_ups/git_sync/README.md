## Integration Instance Selection Logic

### Overview

When pulling playbooks from Git, the integration automatically assigns integration instances to playbook steps. This process is critical for ensuring playbooks function correctly in the target environment. The selection logic follows a hierarchical approach based on environment configuration and instance availability. There are limitations to the matching, especially when using the integration to sync between different server instances.

### Selection Process Flow

```
1. Check for Existing Step Instance
   ↓
2. Determine Environment Strategy
   ↓
3. Find Available Integration Instances
   ↓
4. Apply Selection Logic
   ↓
5. Configure Step Parameters
```

### Environment-Based Selection Strategy

#### Single Environment Playbooks

When a playbook is assigned to **one specific environment** (not "All Environments"):

```python
# Example: Playbook assigned to "Production" environment
environments = ["Production"]
```

**Selection Logic:**
1. **Primary Instance**: Search for instance with similar 'display name' configured in the environment
2. **Display Name Matching**: In the case there was not match, look for similar display name in the shared environment ("*")
3. **First Available**: If display name resolution fails, use the first available instance (configured instances are preferred)
4. **Fallback**: If no instance found, leave unassigned

**Configuration Result:**
- `IntegrationInstance`: Direct instance ID or first available instance
- `FallbackIntegrationInstance`: Fallback instance (if configured)

#### Multi-Environment or Shared Playbooks

When a playbook is assigned to **multiple environments** or **"All Environments"**:

```python
# Examples:
environments = ["*"]  # All Environments
environments = ["Env1", "Env2", "Env3"]  # Multiple environments
```

**Selection Logic:**
1. **Automatic Mode**: Set step to use "AutomaticEnvironment"
2. **Shared Instance Search**: Look for instances in the shared environment ("*")
3. **Fallback Assignment**: Assign the first shared instance as fallback

**Configuration Result:**
- `IntegrationInstance`: "AutomaticEnvironment"
- `FallbackIntegrationInstance`: First available shared instance

### Integration Instance Matching

The system searches for integration instances using flexible matching criteria:

#### Exact Match
```python
instance["integrationIdentifier"] == "VirusTotal"
```

#### Shared Prefix Match
```python
instance["integrationIdentifier"] == "Shared_VirusTotal"
```

This allows for shared instances that can be used across multiple environments, addressing the common pattern where shared instances are prefixed with "Shared_".

### Instance Search and Caching

#### Search Scope
- **Environment-Specific**: Search within the specified environment
- **Cross-Environment**: For shared playbooks, search the shared environment ("*")
- **Cached Results**: Instance lists are cached per environment for performance

#### Instance Validation
- Both **configured and unconfigured** instances are now considered
- Instances are sorted with **configured instances first**, then alphabetically by name — this ensures a configured instance is always preferred when selecting the first available
- Unconfigured instances serve as fallbacks when no configured instance is available

### Existing Step Reuse Logic

When updating an existing playbook, the system attempts to preserve instance assignments, but now **validates** them first:

```python
if existing_step:
    # Copy instance configuration from existing step
    instance_id = existing_step.parameters["IntegrationInstance"].value
    fallback_id = existing_step.parameters["FallbackIntegrationInstance"].value

    # Determine which instance to validate
    # For "AutomaticEnvironment" mode, validate the fallback instance instead
    instance_to_validate = instance_id
    if instance_id == "AutomaticEnvironment":
        instance_to_validate = fallback_id

    # Only reuse if the instance actually exists on the target platform
    if _is_valid_existing_instance(integration, instance_to_validate, environments):
        new_step.parameters["IntegrationInstance"].value = instance_id
        new_step.parameters["FallbackIntegrationInstance"].value = fallback_id
    else:
        # Fall through to instance-discovery logic
        ...
```

This prevents broken playbooks caused by copying instance IDs from prior failed imports or from instances that no longer exist on the target platform. If the existing instance is invalid, the system falls through to the standard instance-discovery logic described above.

### Display Name Resolution

The system stores and attempts to resolve instance display names:

1. **Store Display Names**: When pushing playbooks, display names are stored in step parameters
2. **Resolve on Pull**: When pulling playbooks, the system attempts to find instances by display name
3. **Fallback to ID**: If display name resolution fails, fall back to direct instance assignment

### Common Scenarios and Behaviors

#### Scenario 1: Single Environment with Available Instance
- **Environment**: "Production"
- **Available Instances**: ["VirusTotal_Prod", "Shared_VirusTotal"]
- **Result**: Uses "VirusTotal_Prod" (environment-specific instance preferred)

#### Scenario 2: Single Environment with No Direct Instance
- **Environment**: "Development"  
- **Available Instances in Development**: None
- **Available Instances in Shared ("*")**: ["Shared_VirusTotal"]
- **Result**: Falls back to the shared environment and uses "Shared_VirusTotal"

#### Scenario 3: Multi-Environment Playbook
- **Environment**: ["*"] (All Environments)
- **Available Instances**: ["VirusTotal_Dev", "Shared_VirusTotal"]
- **Result**: 
  - `IntegrationInstance`: "AutomaticEnvironment"
  - `FallbackIntegrationInstance`: "Shared_VirusTotal"

#### Scenario 4: Multi-Environment Playbook with No Shared Instance
- **Environments**: ["Env1", "Env2"]
- **Available Shared Instances**: None
- **Available in Env1**: ["VirusTotal_Env1"]
- **Result**:
  - `IntegrationInstance`: "AutomaticEnvironment"
  - `FallbackIntegrationInstance`: "VirusTotal_Env1" (found by iterating individual environments)

#### Scenario 5: Existing Step with Invalid Instance
- **Existing Step Instance**: "old-uuid-from-source-server"
- **Available Instances on Target**: ["VirusTotal_Prod"]
- **Result**: Validation fails for the old instance ID → falls through to discovery logic → assigns "VirusTotal_Prod"

#### Scenario 6: Missing Environment on Target System
- **Source Environment**: "Staging" (doesn't exist on target)
- **Available Instances**: ["VirusTotal_Prod", "Shared_VirusTotal"]
- **Result**: May fail to find appropriate instance, requiring manual configuration

### Troubleshooting Instance Selection

#### Common Issues

1. **Instance Not Found**
   - **Cause**: No configured instances for the integration in target environment
   - **Solution**: Create and configure integration instance in target environment

2. **Wrong Instance Selected**
   - **Cause**: Multiple instances available, system selects first alphabetically
   - **Solution**: Use shared instances with "Shared_" prefix or ensure consistent naming

3. **Cross-Server Migration Issues**
   - **Cause**: Environment names differ between source and target systems
   - **Solution**: Create matching environments or use shared instances

4. **Playbook Step Using Unconfigured Instance**
   - **Cause**: No configured instances available; system assigned an unconfigured instance as fallback
   - **Solution**: Complete the integration instance configuration on the target platform

#### Debugging Tips

1. **Check Integration Instances**: Verify instances exist and are configured in target environment
2. **Review Environment Assignment**: Ensure playbook environment assignment matches available environments
3. **Use Shared Instances**: For cross-environment compatibility, use instances with "Shared_" prefix
4. **Check Instance Names**: Ensure consistent naming conventions across environments
5. **Review Logs**: Check SecOps logs for instance selection details and errors

2. **Development**: Make changes in SecOps
3. **Commit Changes**: Use Push jobs to sync changes to Git
4. **Review & Merge**: Review changes in Git, merge to main branch
5. **Deploy**: Use Pull jobs to deploy to other environments

### Cross-Environment Deployment

```bash
# Development Environment
1. Develop playbook in Dev environment
2. Push playbook: "Push Playbook" job
3. Commit to feature branch in Git

# Production Environment  
1. Merge feature branch to main
2. Pull playbook: "Pull Playbook" job
3. Verify instance assignments
4. Test playbook functionality
```

### Integration Instance Management

```bash
# Ensure Consistent Instance Names
Development: "VirusTotal_Dev"
Staging: "VirusTotal_Stage"  
Production: "VirusTotal_Prod"
Shared: "Shared_VirusTotal" (for cross-env playbooks)
```

## Best Practices

### Instance Naming Conventions

1. **Environment-Specific**: Use environment suffix (`IntegrationName_EnvName`)
2. **Shared Instances**: Use "Shared_" prefix for cross-environment instances
3. **Consistent Naming**: Maintain consistent naming patterns across environments

### Environment Strategy

1. **Single Environment**: Use for environment-specific playbooks
2. **All Environments**: Use for playbooks that should work across all environments
3. **Shared Instances**: Create shared instances for cross-environment compatibility

### Repository Management

1. **Branch Strategy**: Use feature branches for development, main for production
2. **Commit Messages**: Use descriptive commit messages for tracking changes
3. **Regular Sync**: Establish regular sync schedules for content synchronization

### Security Considerations

1. **Credential Management**: Use secure credential storage (tokens, SSH keys)
2. **Access Control**: Limit repository access to authorized personnel
3. **SSL Verification**: Enable SSL verification for production environments
4. **Audit Trail**: Maintain commit history for compliance and auditing
